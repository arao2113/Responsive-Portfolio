            <img src='assets/images/doge.jpg' alt="A picture of dog" class="image">

            <p>Hello there my name is Ara, and that's not a picture of me for your information. Although I do have two Shiba Inu's, and they are the best dogs. I decided to join this bootcamp after careful consideration and research. I was attending school at LAVC and CSUN majoring in computer science. I've dabbled a little into coding, specificaly C++ and visual basic. I found the curriculam at these colleges to be out of touch with what will actually make me a good coder or most important job ready. </p>

            <p>I grew up in the Los Angeles area, and have been here the majority of my life. Some of my hobbies include: surfing the web (reddit my fav), video games (Dota2), and watching basketball (Lakers are my team). I'm hoping to learn the necessary skills by November of this year to be job ready. The goal is to find a career by the end of this year where I can be proud of my career choice. </p>
